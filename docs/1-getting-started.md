# Getting Started

AudioStream enables users of the FreeClimb platform to interact with phone calls via streaming, instead of callback based PerCL.
This enables new and innovative functionality similar to having a SIP endpoint but without requiring the complexity.
The AudioStream command sets up a gRPC channel to the client application, this runs over HTTP2. Since gRPC runs over HTTP2 this can be proxied like regular HTTP2 traffic. This channel is persistent per call and cannot be transferred at this time.
gRPC uses Protocol Buffers to standardize the message shape and structure over the wire, but it also enables users to automatically generate preliminary client/server implementations.

## Requirements

- FreeClimb account, number, and application
- gRPC server capable of handling [bidirectional streaming](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc)
- Webserver to return PerCL to configure Audio Streaming

## PerCL, gRPC, and Webhooks

FreeClimb has a variety of ways to communicate with applications both to receive commands as well as simply notify the user application of a certain event.
Webhooks are used to notify the application that an event has taken place. They only occur outside of the context of the Audio Stream, as the Audio Stream handles all of the audio and other events that would conventionally be handled by PerCL and webhooks in a FreeClimb application.
In order to handle both webhooks and gRPC traffic, 2 seperate applications would be used (though they can be combined), one to handle the HTTP webhooks and one to handle the gRPC channels.

### Inbound Call

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
actor c as Customer
participant s as Freeclimb Server
participant cw as Freeclimb Streaming Customer Webhook/PerCL Endpoint
participant cl as Freeclimb Streaming Customer gRPC Endpoint
c ->> s: Establish SIP Phone Call
s ->> cw: Inbound call webhook to retrieve PerCL
s ->> cl: Establish gRPC Channel (all communication happens over this channel)
s ->> cl: gRPC NotifyCallStartedMessage
loop Until Call Completes
s ->> cl: gRPC NotifyAudioMessage
end
s ->> cl: gRPC NotifyCallEndedMessage
s ->> cw: Call Status webhook indicating completion reason
```

### Outbound Call

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
actor e as PSTN Location
participant s as Freeclimb Server
participant cw as Freeclimb Streaming Customer Webhook/PerCL Endpoint
participant cl as Freeclimb Streaming Customer gRPC Endpoint

cw ->> s: Request Outdial to PSTN Number
s ->> e: Establish SIP Phone Call
s ->> cw: Outbound call started, webhook to retrieve PerCL
s ->> cl: Establish gRPC Channel (all communication happens over this channel)
s ->> cl: gRPC NotifyCallStartedMessage
loop Until Call Completes
s ->> cl: gRPC NotifyAudioMessage
end
s ->> cl: gRPC NotifyCallEndedMessage
s ->> cw: Call Status webhook indicating completion reason
```
